 * This lives on the labs host, not the main API: `api.listenbrainz.org/1/
 * similar-artists` redirects and then 404s, which the caller couldn't tell
 * apart from an artist with no similar artists, so the shelf on Home was
 * silently empty for everyone rather than failing where anyone would see it.
 *
 * The labs endpoint has no count parameter; it returns the algorithm's full
 * list and the caller takes the top of it.
